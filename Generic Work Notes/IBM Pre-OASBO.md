### VMware perpetual license
 - once end support with vmware -> entitled to latest version, but cannot upgrade from there
	 -  This allows us to be supported by IBM to keep our vm's hardened and time to switch to another vm provider.

#####  I  think we should go to Azure vms and utilize power apps for integrations

#####  OECM - VOR (Vulnerability and pen testing)
- Privacy Assessments!? Maybe we can offload some of VASPs work to them.


RFP/ RFQ - procurement vehicle 
- Open market bid
- no 2% fee 
- potentially lower cost

> [!Info] Common Mistakes
> - Not including all project folders: If you do this, you are NOT sending me all your code. That is an automatic zero.
> - Sending a .sln file only. By doing this, you are not sending me your code. That would be a zero, again. 
> - Submitting a folder shortcut: Again, if you do this, you are NOT sending me your code. Automatic zero.
> - Not  separating individual exercises in individual projects/folders: Again, the  expectation is ONE solution, and multiple projects (or folders) inside. 
>   - Each project  is one exercise (except for exercises that belong together, for example, if exercise 2 is a continuation of exercise 1).
>   - You should name your projects accordingly, so I  know what each one is. 
>   - Consider this a technical requirement, and again, as a software engineer, it is your job to adhere  to it and make sure you deliver what is expected of you. 
>   - I am easygoing  with marks, but that doesn't mean anything will do - let's maintain **good standards!**
> - Creating one solution per exercise: Again, not the requirement. Same as above.

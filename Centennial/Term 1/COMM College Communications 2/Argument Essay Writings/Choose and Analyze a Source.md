**Summary**

In Why Social Media is Ruining Your Relationships, Katherine Ormerod discusses how social media is affecting our relationships in a negative way. She claims that while these platforms make us feel connected, much of the interaction is shallow and lacks depth. Ormerod highlights the difference between engaging actively with others online and simply observing others without interacting, the latter often resulting in feelings of inadequacy or loneliness. Her overall argument is that social media prioritizes the number of connections over the quality, making it harder to form and maintain meaningful relationships with close friends, family, and partners.

**Exploration**

Ormerod’s argument comes across as well-thought-out and logical. She uses relevant research, such as Dunbar's theory on how many relationships a person can realistically manage, to back up her point that social media leads to more surface-level connections. Some might find this reasoning sound because it aligns with the common experience of feeling more fulfilled by real conversations than by browsing online content. The argument is grounded in real-world examples of how social media shapes our behavior, making it understandable why some might agree with her views on the downsides of digital interaction.

**Skepticism/Questioning**

While Ormerod’s argument is strong, there are potential flaws. One might argue that the issue is not with social media itself but with how people choose to use it. Some users are able to maintain meaningful relationships through these platforms, especially when distance or time makes in-person meetings difficult. Additionally, the focus on loneliness caused by social media use might overlook other important factors, such as social or economic challenges. A question worth asking is whether the platforms are inherently harmful or if people can adjust their behavior to avoid the negative consequences she describes.

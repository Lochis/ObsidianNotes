- **Check for previous work:** Look around to see if someone else has already fact-checked the claim or provided a synthesis of research.  

- **Go upstream to the source:** Go “upstream” to the source of the claim. Most web content is not original. Get to the original source to understand the trustworthiness of the information.  

- **Read laterally:** Read laterally.[[1]](https://pressbooks.pub/webliteracy/chapter/four-strategies/#footnote-24-1) Once you get to the source of a claim, read what other people say about the source (publication, author, etc.). The truth is in the network.  

- **Circle back:** If you get lost, hit dead ends, or find yourself going down an increasingly confusing rabbit hole, back up and start over knowing what you know now. You’re likely to take a more informed path with different search terms and better decisions.

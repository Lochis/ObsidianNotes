The criteria for a linear equation:
1. The highest power of the variable (in this case, x) should be 1.
2. There should be no products of variables.
3. There should be no square roots or other roots of variables.

NOTE: √n = n1/2  
NOTE: √(ab) = √a × √b  
NOTE: √(a/b) = √a / √b


Simplified Form:  
The simplified form for a square root radical has 3 characteristics:  
1. The radicand does not contain a factor that’s a perfect square.  
2. The radicand contains no fractions.  
3. No denominator contains a radical.  
Examples:  
(a) ¾ - Rational  
(b) 0.333.... = 1/3 – Rational  
(c) √5 = 2.23606797749979..... – Irrational  
(d) π – Irrational  
(e) 0.1010010001.... - Irrational  
Examples:  
(a) √44 = 6.63324958  
- Not a perfect square  
- Not an irrational number  
√44 = 6.63324958 = 663,324,958 / 100,000,000  
(b) √(6/5) = √(1.2) = 1.09544512  
- Not a perfect square  
- Not an irrational number

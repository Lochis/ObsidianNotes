# 2024-Jul-29-What-to-do

I am told that I am consistently making Mona feel anxious.

## A few points come to mind, especially after our talk today:
1. **I do not prioritize eating meals**
- This causes Mona to get frustrated as she worries about when and what I'm eating.
2. **I am told that I do not respect her when I try to keep the relationship in tact.**
- This is because she believe that letting her go is the best for everyone.
  - She would be able to sit alone with her thoughts and feelings about herself.
  - *I do not agree with that this should be the way*.
  - It doesn't help anyone. It just makes us lose more.
3. **Costco** She wants to enjoy Costco and my low patience comes through when I didn't eat that morning.
- This is furthered by the fact I am surrounded by so many people. 
- I, unjustifiably, give sassy remarks and this, of course, annoys and makes Mona feel bad about the whole experience.

## Ideas on how to make this better:
1. Eat more often so that she doesn't worry about if I am eating enough.
2. Probably will just have to be perfect.
3. Shut up and just enjoy the time with your woman, idiot.
